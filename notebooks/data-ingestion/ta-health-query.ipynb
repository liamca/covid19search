    "text = 'Since publication of the last dermatology issue of Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice in 2013, considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of dermatologic disease, particularly allergic skin disease. These advances have translated into new tools for the management of canine allergic dermatitis. The goals of this issue are to provide readers with a comprehensive review of therapeutic options for allergic dermatitis (with a focus on atopic dermatitis) as well as to review other dermatologic diseases that have been more recently described or are not thoroughly reviewed elsewhere in the veterinary medical literature. Each review provides practical guidelines for practitioners in disease recognition, diagnosis, and clinical management. My hope is that these articles will equip  ractitioners with the background knowledge necessary to tackle the clinical challenges presented by dermatologic diseases, and to highlight areas for further research and exploration within our exciting and ever-changing field.Successful management of canine atopic dermatitis often requires a multimodal approach: improving the cutaneous barrier, managing secondary infections, and immunomodulation. The first article provides  n update to clinicians on allergen-specific immunotherapy, including more recently implemented forms of immunotherapy in veterinary patients (sublingual immunotherapy and intralymphatic immunotherapy). The  second article provides a comprehensive review of symptomatic management options for atopic dermatitis, with a focus on new and evolving therapies. The authors of the next four articles review immune-mediated dermatoses  that are emerging or have an incompletely elucidated pathogenesis. These articles review sterile inflammatory conditions: canine acute eosinophilic dermatitis with edema and Vet Clin Small Anim 49 (2019) ix–x https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvsm.2018.09.001 vetsmall.theclinics.com 0195-5616/19/ª 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. Small Animal Dermatology sterile pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis, as well as canine perianal  istulas and two recently recognized forms of canine cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Canine cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma is one of the most devastating conditions encountered in small animal dermatology and carries a poor prognosis. It can also be one of the most challenging conditions for practitioners to recognize given its clinical similarities to other dermatoses. The author of this article reviews the clinical  resentation, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options for canine cutaneous epithelitropic T-cell lymphoma as well as two rare forms of cutaneous lymphoma: feline cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma and cutaneous lymphocytosis. The importance of quality of life in pets with dermatologic disease as well as the owners of pets with dermatologic disease cannot be overstated. Many skin conditions, including several of  those highlighted in this issue, are chronic, incurable, and associated with the need for lifelong or labor-intensive management. One article in this issue details the development and validation of tools for the assessment of quality of life in dogs and cats with dermatologic disease. These tools will allow the evaluation of quality of life (of patients and pet owners) as an additional metric for determining treatment success in clinical trials, which guide our evidence-based practice of veterinary dermatology. Two articles review common conditions in small animal dermatology. One article emphasizes a practical approach to clinical recognition, diagnosis (including tips for optimal skin biopsy technique), and management of feline pemphigus foliaceus, the most common autoimmune dermatosis of cats. In another article, the author provides a useful algorithm for approaching the diagnostic workup and management of patients with acral lick dermatitis. Like many other chronic skin conditions, successful management requires the clinician to recognize and effectively address multiple primary and perpetuating factors. It was a privilege serving as guest editor of this issue. I would like to sincerely thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication in lending their expertise to these articles. Christine L.
